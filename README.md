Problem 1 is written in C++, and uses an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for adjacency matrices. To run it on a test case, pass the adjacency matrix as a vector< vector< int >> into the dijkstra function, along with the source and destination indices. 

Problem 2 is written in C++. To run the code on a test case, simply write the matrix as a vector< vector< int > > object and pass into the spiral_print function.
